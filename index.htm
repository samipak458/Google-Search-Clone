  <!-- As you probably expected, you should see Google search results for “Harvard.” But now, take a look at the URL. 
    It should begin with https://www.google.com/search, the route on Google’s website that allows for searching. 
    But following the route is a "?", followed by some additional information -->

    <form action="https://google.com/search">

  <!-- Those additional pieces of information in the URL are known as a query string.
       one of the GET parameters in the URL is q=Harvard. "=" separates the name of the parameter from its value.
       This suggests that the name for the parameter corresponding to a Google search is q (likely short for “query”).
       only the q parameter is required to perform a search.  -->
